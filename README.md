JC2MP-EnhancedChat
==================

More added Chat possibilities for JC2MP

- Global Chat
- Team Chat (the very default, not recommended)
- Local Chat
- Car Chat

To toggle between these type F2 on your keyboard. By default the Chat Mode is the Global Chat.

You can change the key in the init of the client file: self.key = "Your wished key"

Future ideas:
- change the distance of Local Chat for every Single Player
- MultiColor Chat Strings (at the moment really difficult to realize)
